# Code of Conduct

This repository follows [the same code of conduct as the Rust project](https://www.rust-lang.org/policies/code-of-conduct).  
However, since this project isn't directly part of the latter, you should contact me at [tamme@schichler.dev](mailto:tamme@schichler.dev) or [Tamschi.32 (Signal)](https://signal.me/#eu/E-K8EwDr8syjNkAZmN0LVIFSAZzn0zugRN1rAeBbePKC9UJysCRGK6eo4HhGoYMg) in case there's an issue in this regard.
