# `flourish`

Convenient and composable signals for Rust.

The API design emphasises efficient resource management and performance-aware code without compromising on ease of use at near-zero boilerplate.

🚧 This is a(n optimisable) proof of concept! 🚧  
🚧 The API is full-featured, but the code is not (much at all) optimised. 🚧

Flourish is a signals library inspired by [🚦 JavaScript Signals standard proposal🚦](https://github.com/tc39/proposal-signals?tab=readme-ov-file#-javascript-signals-standard-proposal) (but Rust-y).

When combined with for example [`Option`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/core/option/enum.Option.html) and [`Future`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/core/future/trait.Future.html), `flourish` can model asynchronous-and-cancellable resource loads. See the crate `flourish-extra` for example combinators and `flourish-extensions` to use them conveniently through constructor extensions.

This makes it a suitable replacement for most standard use cases of RxJS-style observables, though with the included runtime it may debounce propagation and as such isn't suited for sequences. (You should probably prefer channels for those. flourish does work well with reference-counted resources, however, and can flush them from stale unsubscribed signals. //TODO)

## Known Issues

⚠️ The update task queue is currently not fair whatsoever, so one thread looping inside signal processing will block all others.  
(You *can* substitute your own `SignalsRuntimeRef` implementation if you'd like to experiment. Nearly all types in this crate are generic over the runtime, so that which you're working with is easy to identify.)

⚠️ The panic handling in the included runtime really isn't good.  
Fixing this doesn't incur API changes, and I don't need it right now, so I haven't implemented panic routing that would preserve the runtime when callbacks fail.

❔ There may be some holes in the API where I forgot something.  
Feel free to [file issues](https://github.com/Tamschi/flourish/issues) for these!

## Prelude

Flourish's prelude re-exports its accessor traits anonymously.

If you can't call `.get()` or `.change(…)`, this import is what you're looking for:

```rust
use flourish::prelude::*;
```

## Quick-Start

For libraries (which should be generic over the signals runtime `SR`):

```sh
cargo add flourish
```

For applications ("batteries included"):

```sh
cargo add flourish --features global_signals_runtime
```

You can put signals on the heap:

```rust
use flourish::{SignalCell, Propagation, Signal, Subscription, Effect};

let _ = SignalCell::new(());
let _ = SignalCell::new_cyclic(|_weak| ());
let _ = SignalCell::new_reactive((), |_value, _status| Propagation::Halt);
let _ = SignalCell::new_reactive_mut((), |_value, _status| Propagation::Propagate);
let _ = SignalCell::new_cyclic_reactive(|_weak| ((), move |_value, _status| Propagation::Halt));
let _ = SignalCell::new_cyclic_reactive_mut(|_weak| ((), move |_value, _status| Propagation::Propagate));

// The closure type is erased!
// Not evaluated unless subscribed.
let _ = Signal::computed(|| ());
let _ = Signal::debounced(|| ());
let _ = Signal::computed_uncached(|| ()); // `Fn` closure. The others take `FnMut`s.
let _ = Signal::computed_uncached_mut(|| ());
let _ = Signal::folded((), |_value| Propagation::Propagate);
let _ = Signal::reduced(|| (), |_value, _next| Propagation::Propagate);

// The closure type is erased!
let _ = Subscription::computed(|| ());
let _ = Subscription::folded((), |_value| Propagation::Propagate);
let _ = Subscription::reduced(|| (), |_value, _next| Propagation::Propagate);

// The closure and value type are erased!
// Runs `drop` *before* computing the new value.
let _ = Effect::new(|| (), drop);

// "Splitting":
let (_signal, _cell) = SignalCell::new(()).into_signal_and_self();
let (_signal, _type_erased_cell) = SignalCell::new(()).into_signal_and_self_dyn();
```

You can also put signals on the stack:

```rust
use flourish::{signals_helper, prelude::*, Propagation};

signals_helper! {
  let inert_cell = inert_cell!(());
  let reactive_cell = reactive_cell!((), |_value, _status| Propagation::Halt);

  // The closure type is erased!
  // Not evaluated unless subscribed.
  let _source = computed!(|| ());
  let _source = debounced!(|| ());
  let _source = computed_uncached!(|| ());
  let _source = computed_uncached_mut!(|| ());
  let _source = folded!((), |_value| Propagation::Propagate);
  let _source = reduced!(|| (), |_value, _next| Propagation::Propagate);

  // The closure type is erased!
  let _source = subscription!(|| ());

  // Runs `drop` *before* computing the new value.
  let _effect = effect!(|| (), drop);
}

// "Splitting":
let (_source, _source_cell) = inert_cell.as_source_and_cell();
let (_source, _source_cell) = reactive_cell.as_source_and_cell();
```

Additionally, inside `flourish::raw`, you can find constructor functions for unpinned raw signals that enable composition with data-inlining.

## Linking signals

`flourish` detects and updates dependencies automatically:

```rust
use flourish::{prelude::*, shadow_clone, SignalCell, Signal, Subscription};

let a = SignalCell::new("a");
let b = SignalCell::new("b");
let c = SignalCell::new("c");
let d = SignalCell::new("d");
let e = SignalCell::new("e");
let f = SignalCell::new("f");
let g = SignalCell::new("g");
let index = SignalCell::new(0);

let signal = Signal::computed({
  shadow_clone!(a, b, c, d, e, f, g, index);
  move || println!("{}", match index.get() {
    1 => a.get(),
    2 => b.get(),
    3 => c.get(),
    4 => d.get(),
    5 => e.get(),
    6 => f.get(),
    7 => g.get(),
    _ => "",
  })
}); // nothing

let subscription = Subscription::computed(|| signal.touch()); // ""

// Note: `change` and `replace` may be deferred (but are safe to use in callbacks)!
//        Use the `…_blocking` and `…_async` variants as needed.
a.replace("a"); b.replace("b"); // nothing
index.change(1); // "a" ("change" methods don't replace or propagate if the value is equal)
a.change("aa"); // "aa"
b.change("bb"); // nothing
index.change(2); // "bb"
a.change("a"); // nothing
b.change("b"); // "b"

drop(subscription);
index.change(3); // nothing
```

`Signal`s are fully lazy, so they only update while subscribed or to refresh their value if dirty.

The default `GlobalSignalsRuntime` notifies signals iteratively from earlier to later when possible. Only one such notification cascade is processed at a time with this runtime.

("uncached" signals run their closure whenever their value is retrieved instead, not on update.)

## Unsizing

TODO

## Using a different runtime

You can use a different [`isoprenoid`] runtime with the included types and macros (but ideally, alias these items for your own use):

```rust
use flourish::{signals_helper, GlobalSignalsRuntime, SignalSR, SignalCell, SubscriptionSR, Propagation};

let _ = SignalCell::with_runtime((), GlobalSignalsRuntime);

let _ = SignalSR::computed_with_runtime(|| (), GlobalSignalsRuntime);
let _ = SignalSR::computed_uncached_with_runtime(|| (), GlobalSignalsRuntime);
let _ = SignalSR::computed_uncached_mut_with_runtime(|| (), GlobalSignalsRuntime);
let _ = SignalSR::folded_with_runtime((), |_value| Propagation::Propagate, GlobalSignalsRuntime);
let _ = SignalSR::reduced_with_runtime(|| (), |_value, _next| Propagation::Propagate, GlobalSignalsRuntime);

let _ = SubscriptionSR::computed_with_runtime(|| (), GlobalSignalsRuntime);

signals_helper! {
  let _inert_cell = inert_cell_with_runtime!((), GlobalSignalsRuntime);

  let _source = computed_with_runtime!(|| (), GlobalSignalsRuntime);
  let _source = computed_uncached_with_runtime!(|| (), GlobalSignalsRuntime);
  let _source = computed_uncached_mut_with_runtime!(|| (), GlobalSignalsRuntime);
  let _source = folded_with_runtime!((), |_value| Propagation::Propagate, GlobalSignalsRuntime);
  let _source = reduced_with_runtime!(|| (), |_value, _next| Propagation::Propagate, GlobalSignalsRuntime);

  let _source = subscription_with_runtime!(|| (), GlobalSignalsRuntime);

  let _effect = effect_with_runtime!(|| (), drop, GlobalSignalsRuntime);
}
```

Runtimes have some leeway regarding in which order they invoke the callbacks. A different runtime may also choose to combine propagation from distinct updates, reducing the amount of callback runs.

## Compiler Wishlist

Several improvements to this library are postponed pending certain compiler features (getting stabilised).

This mainly affects certain optimisations not being in place yet, but does have some small effects on the API where I had to use workarounds.

|Feature|What it would enable|
|-|-|
|[`coerce_unsized`](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/18598)|Unsizing coercions for various `SourcePin` (handle) types.<br>For now, please use `.into_dyn()` or the `From`/`Into` conversions instead.|
|[`trait_upcasting`](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/65991)|Shrink `SignalCellSR` and `SignalCellRef` by at least half.|
|Fix for [Unexpected higher-ranked lifetime error in GAT usage](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/100013)|(Cleanly) avoid boxing the inner closure in many "`_eager`" methods.|
|Object-safety for `trait Guard: Deref + Borrow<Self::Target> {}` as `dyn Guard<Target = …>`|I think this is caused by use of the associated type as type parameter in any bound (of self or an associated type). It works fine with `Guard<T>`, but that's not ideal since `Guard` is implicitly unique per implementing type.|
